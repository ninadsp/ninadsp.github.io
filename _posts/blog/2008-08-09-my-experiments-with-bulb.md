Here's a snap from a set that I have been working on. It's from a set, 'My Experiments With Bulb', an attempt to capture the simple light bulb from different angles. This snap was clicked during the Photography Workshop Clicking sessions in APOGEE '08. It was clicked while Tullu was upto his tricks, clicking snaps for the 'On The Spot' competition. Clicked with Apoorv's Canon S5IS in B/W mode. A sepia shade was added to it in Photoshop, along with the watermark and the border. To see more of My Experiments With Bulb, visit this or [this][1].
