Here are a few events coming up this week, that I am looking forward to:

**World Photography Day, 19th August**: The Photography Club is celebrating the World Photography Day by putting up an **exhibition**, showcasing the recent work of some of the Club's members. Also, a **documentary video** will be shown, based on the experiences of a war photographer. The major attraction of the day is the opening up of **BITS & pixels**, a photography competition unlike anything ever before.

**Astronomy Club Interactions and Quiz**: The Astronomy Club will be hosting it's interactions in it's search for new, dedicated members, to carry on it's work. The interactions will be held on the *21st of August, Thursday*. Also, Astro Club's yearly quiz, the **AstroNut 2k8** has been scheduled for the *23rd* of this month. Keep checking the Astro Club Blog for further details about both these events.

On a different note, here's something for you guys to ponder over&#8230; This is a puzzle that I am putting for all the ACAD readers. What is this image exactly and what did I have to do to get to this stage? The first person to answer the entire question correctly shall get an *ANC treat* from me!

***EDIT: The deadline is 2359 hrs, 20th August!***
