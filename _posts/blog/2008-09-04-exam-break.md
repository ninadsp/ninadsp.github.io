Hey everyone, this blog gets a break for this week, thanks to exams&#8230; :unamused:. Meanwhile, here are some things that I have been up to in the last few days&#8230;

Clicking and processing more snaps - Check my recent uploads of the SPIC MACAY concerts [here][1]. Do keep checking it as I'll be uploading some on Friday and Saturday as well.

I found these tutorials on the net - [The .htaccess Guide][2]. Real useful.  
I have also been blog hunting, and these blogs have been added to my feed reader: ~~Rachit's Blog~~, [Amey][3], Gallery Feed and ~~VU3RDD Station Log~~.

And yeah, a nice chat with Kevin Smith (Project Maintainer) of Psi cleared any airs about me trying to compile `libjingle` support in Psi. It hasn't been successfully attempted by anybody in the last couple of years, and no other client has been able to integrate `libjingle` very well. Bad news for all us Linux users&#8230; :unamused:

Till Sunday, adios! :smile:
