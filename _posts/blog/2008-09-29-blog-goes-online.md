I have now moved my blog online to [http://ninad.x10hosting.com/blog/][1]. Surprisingly, the shifting of the blog to a new [host][2] was not at all difficult, except for the part of uploading the *.tar.bz2* file to the new location. This is due to the great internet connection at my college. A how-to to setup a WP blog on this host will be up soon&#8230; :smile:

*P.S.:* As of 2011, [this][1] location no longer exists as I stopped using the service.
