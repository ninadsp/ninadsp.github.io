Here are a few sites that I have been reading recently:

  * [MD-5 Decryptor!][1]: This is an attempt at creating a database of MD-5 hashes. Now, people will have apprehensions, but I guess it's useful for Network Admins who can check out the weak passwords of users. The list of popular searches is interesting.
  * [Stellarium 0.10][2]: [Stellarium][3], a brilliant Open Source Virtual Planeterium just released it's newest version, 0.10. Sadly, I have been fighting *dependency hell* in an attempt to compile and install it.
  * [This][4] and [this][5], due to a sudden spike of interest in Cryptography. I also owe this sudden interest to the TV series [Numb3rs][6].
  * Finally, gOS 3.0 Gadgets is available [here][7]. I'll get a review on this as soon as I get my hands on an ISO image. Have been eagerly waiting for this.
  * [Amarok 2 Beta 2][8] has been included in the Kubuntu Repositories. :smile:
  * [NASA Images.org][9]: This is an attempt by the [Internet Archive][10] to put together NASA's freely available images into a single archive. A good effort.
