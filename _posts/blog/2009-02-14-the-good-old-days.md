There used to be a time, when the only thing we watched TV for was cartoons&#8230;

There used to be a time, when we would comb through libraries for the latest Hardy Boys and Harry Potter&#8230;

There used to be a time, when we were innocent&#8230;

There used to be a time, when the only thing that mattered were friends&#8230;

There used to be a time, when the report card at the end of the semester was a highly dreaded peice of paper&#8230;

There used to be a time, when we would make pure fun of our teachers&#8230;

There used to be a time, when our parents and teachers were our first idols&#8230;

There used to be a time, when all our actions were spontaneous, and not planned and conceitful&#8230;

There used to be a time, when the candy at the canteen used to be a weekly treat&#8230;

There used to be a time, when we dreamed big&#8230;

There used to be a time, called childhood&#8230;

There used to be a place, called school&#8230;

They were the good old days&#8230; Never to come back again&#8230;

I miss you all&#8230; **Ashish, Rohan, Saurabh, Udyam, Â Anant, Manoj, Tejashree, Pushkar, Tejas**, and everyone from **RJEMHS **&** Xavier's**&#8230;
