There used to be a time, when the only thing we watched TV for was cartoons...
There used to be a time, when we would comb through libraries for the latest Hardy Boys and Harry Potter...
There used to be a time, when we were innocent...
There used to be a time, when the only thing that mattered were friends...
There used to be a time, when the report card at the end of the semester was a highly dreaded peice of paper...
There used to be a time, when we would make pure fun of our teachers...
There used to be a time, when our parents and teachers were our first idols...
There used to be a time, when all our actions were spontaneous, and not planned and conceitful...
There used to be a time, when the candy at the canteen used to be a weekly treat...
There used to be a time, when we dreamed big...
There used to be a time, called childhood...
There used to be a place, called school...
They were the good old days... Never to come back again...
I miss you all... **Ashish, Rohan, Saurabh, Udyam, Â Anant, Manoj, Tejashree, Pushkar, Tejas**, and everyone from **RJEMHS** & **Xavier's**...
