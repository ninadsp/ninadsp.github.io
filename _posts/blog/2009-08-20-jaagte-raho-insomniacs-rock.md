Many BITSians often ask me, why do I tweet.  There are about 100 BITSians I know, who are on <a href="http://twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.  But, barely 20 among them are active by any standard on Twitter.  What they don't know, is that it took a lot of convincing by [@jeffjose](http://twitter.com/jeffjose "Jeffjose on Twitter"), to get me on to Twitter.  I won't get into all the stuff that he told me, but I will tell you about one very amazing person I found on Twitter, which has ensured that I will never stop using it.

In my third year, I spent a lot of time doing work in the night, and got converted into an insomniac.  I would stay up the whole night, and go to sleep at the crack of dawn, or stay up till breakfast, and sleep after that.  But, I found it quite lonely.  I never had anyone to talk to, while I stayed up.  Though I preferred  it that way, as it ensured complete concentration, I did miss company.  Over the holidays, as I started expanding my Twitter realm beyond BITSians, I found out about [@JaagteRaho](http://twitter.com/JaagteRaho "JaagteRaho on Twitter").  It's name was 'Insomniacs Anonymous' and it had a cute Owl as it's DP.  I instantly liked it, and followed it.  It took me sometime to figure out what was going on, but what happened was this.  @JaagteRaho was the focal point of all insomniac Indians on Twitter.  Everyone posted tweets to @JaagteRaho, and they were ReTweeted (RT'ed) faithfully, for all others to read, and reply to.  The cycle went on and on, and everyone awake ensured that it was a fun place to be.  A lot of links were thrown around, and often, popular tweeple became the center of attention, for their wacky tweets.

I slowly became a regular at @JaagteRaho, and I realised, that I had made lots of new friends at @JaagteRaho.  Now, I stay up at night, with the comfortable knowledge, that whenever I get bored, I'll always have company and people with similar likes to talk to, at any time of the night. :smile:  Some of the awesome people I met at @JaagteRaho include [@meerasapra](http://twitter.com/meerasapra), [@metalsaint](http://twitter.com/metalsaint) [@fossiloflife](http://twitter.com/fossiloflife) (these 2 are the founders, which i came to know later), [@binoyparikh](http://twitter.com/beeayeanoowhyi) [@artihonrao](http://twitter.com/artihonrao), [@kulkarnianiket](http://twitter.com/kulkarnianiket) and a lot more.

So, if you too spend your nights reading books, watching TV, studying, or typing out code on the terminal, make sure that you are on Twitter, and follow [this](http://twitter.com/JaagteRaho).
