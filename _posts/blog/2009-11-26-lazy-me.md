As you guys can see, I've been terribly lazy at writing stuff for the blog. But, I've kept myself busy by uploading some snaps to flickr, so am posting links here, hoping to get back on track with writing as well soon.

A lot of the recent snaps are from Oasis 09, the cultural festival of BITS Pilani. This year, Photog Club has a Canon 1000D, with an awesome 75-300mm lens. I've tried my best to capture some images from the Stage Plays and Choreo. Hope you guys like em&#8230;
