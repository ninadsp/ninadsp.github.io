In my [last post][1], I mentioned that I'll be creating a list of tasks to complete over the summer. It's been posted at [this][2] pastebin. Kindly check it out and add to it if I've missed anything important. :smile:

***Edit:*** This list is now available at the phpMyAdmin wiki at [this address][3]. Â Kindly visit it, and provide your feedback/edit it.
