I have been running an instance of [ThinkUp](http://thinkupapp.com) on this web server for quite a few months. It has been silently chipping away at the mountain of tweets I have posted for the last few years. ThinkUp [reached version 1.0][1] a few days ago, which means that it has completed a basic set of features. It is also now officially out of beta, and hence is stable. They have also done a lot of work on the user interface and have started including elements of the next re-design in this version.

After upgrading to 1.0, I decided to make the instance's Twitter account publicly visible. You can now browse through my tweets, favourites and also read conversations that I have with other tweeps, without actually logging on to Twitter. Visit the instance at [http://ninad.pundaliks.in/thinkup/](http://ninad.pundaliks.in/thinkup). If you love the app, give a shout out to the people behind ThinkUp on [IRC](http://thinkupapp.com/docs/contact.html#irc-channel) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thinkupapp) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/pages/ThinkUp/162504567094163). If you find something wrong, ping their [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/thinkupapp), they'll fix it :).
