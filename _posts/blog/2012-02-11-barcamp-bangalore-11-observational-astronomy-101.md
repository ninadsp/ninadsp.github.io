Content for the [session](http://barcampbangalore.org/bcb/bcb11/observational-astronomy-101) on Observational Astronomy 101 at Barcamp Bangalore 11 can be downloaded from [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2012/02/bcb11_astro101.zip). Almost all the photos are from NASA's amazing [Astronomy Picture of the Day](http://apod.nasa.gov) archive. Some are from Wikipedia. Check the credits.txt file for details.

In the next few days, the Stellarium scripts used will be uploaded to a github repository. I still haven't organized the code, there is quite a bit of copy/pasted code. Once I've modularized it a little more, I'll push it to the repo. Go ahead and fork it once I do that. For instructions on how to use the Stellarium scripts, check their wiki page on [Scripting](http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/Scripts).

As for the crowd sourcing projects that I was talking about, check [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/), [Moon Zoo](http://www.moonzoo.org/), [Galaxy Zoo](http://www.galaxyzoo.org/) and other projects.

Those who are interested in attending Night Sky watching sessions in and around Bangalore, please check the [home page](http://www.bas.org.in/Home/) and [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/b-a-s) of the Bangalore Astronomical Society. They also tweet at [@b_a_s](http://twitter.com/b_a_s).

For any more details, please leave a comment. I tend to forget stuff, so it's your job to remind me ;).
