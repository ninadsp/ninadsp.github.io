![The weekend's haul]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/2012/08/IMG_20120814_084318.jpg)

This week, I complete a year in Bangalore, and my present company. The last weekend was a fitting celebration for both. [Hangman Hacking](https://github.com/ninadsp/hangman-hacking)'s IMDb crawler/parser was written for a challenge at the geekhub at my office, and it won me the 'Geek' t-shirt that you see on the right of the image.  The rest, is all [Yahoo! Open Hack Day 2012](http://hacks.developer.yahoo.com/hacks/yahoo-open-hack-india-2012/event_2).Â Veterans will instantly recognize the purple coloured bean bag that everyone wins. The certificate, the sweatshirt (to the left) and the iPhone 3Gs (in the middle), are all due to [I am Bored](http://hacks.developer.yahoo.com/hack/yahoo-open-hack-india-2012/i-am-bored/event_2/hack_155), my, [Aman](http://twitter.com/amanmanglik) and [Dhruv's](http://twitter.com/dkris) (a.k.a. Dkris) entry for the Hack Day. We won the Hacker's Choice award from around 160+ hacks, of which 40+ battled it out on the stage for the final round.

Friday was spent in playing around with Node.js at the session at office. Though I've attended a session or two before, and read [nodebeginner.org](http://nodebeginner.org) (an excellent starter tutorial), I had never really tried to setup and play around with Node.js. This session made me do it, and I am happy to say, that I'm in love with Node.js.

Saturday (and Sunday, both seemed like the same day to me) was spent in (re-)learning jQuery Mobile. The usual cross-browser inconsistencies, and general lack of support of all libraries for all things Opera, led me to learn the basics of CSS3 animations and gradients. I would have loved to sit with Dkris and figure out [Yahoo Dapper](http://open.dapper.net), but there's only so much that one can do in 24 hours and still push out a decent looking hack for the competition. There was also that amazing session by Girish Dalvi about [Visualizing your Hacks](http://openhackindia2012.hacker.yahoo.net/#meetings/71440). I hope I get to attend more of his sessions soon.

The Yahoo! guys were really considerate, and packed a screen guard and phone case with the phone. The highs of the weekend prodded me, and I decided to finally try putting on screen guards myself. Thank fully, I did not leave any bubbles to play Bubblewrap popper with :).
