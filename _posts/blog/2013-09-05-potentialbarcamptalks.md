Twitter trends have now become the de-facto place for brands to spam everyone's timelines. But, every once in a while, a hashtag comes along and reminds you of the fun times. It may not trend, but it brightens up your TL. A few days before [Barcamp Bangalore][1] 2013 Monsoon Edition, and a couple of days after the announcement of [Barcamp Mumbai][2] 12, people tweeted a slew of #PotentialBarcampTalks. Noting down the ones I noticed:

Seriously interested:

  * On how to make this week count - [@hiway][3]
  * How to attend Barcamp Talks - [@mahafreed][4]
  * Railfanning, the awesome side of Indian Railways - [@whizkidd][5]
  * How to build a SaaS that collects data through normal user behaviour - [@utekkare][6]
  * How to live off a bike - [@mehulved][7] - Also applies for [@hiway][8], for the fuel powered variant :smiley:
  * Google Chrome as an IDE - [@icecubed][9]
  * How to replace myself with a script - [@oddtazz][10]
  * How to attend Yahoo Open Hack Days - [@dkris][11]
  * Car mechanics 101 - [@intelshwets][12]
  * Cats and the Internetz - [@hiway @shadez and @anugadre][13]
  * How to do smoke photography - [@amanmanglik][14]

Fun stuff:

  * How to stay awake for 3 days - [@Quiz_Master][15]
  * Twitter's most eligible bachelor - [@srini091][16]
  * Confidence graph while proposing a girl - [@epandu and @ceetee][17]
  * How to promise and never give a session at Barcamps - [@daaku][18] - [@Sengupta][19] is also credited with a similar idea
  * How to not prepare for a Barcamp session - [me][20]

So, will I get to see any of these sessions at Barcamp Bangalore on 14th September?
