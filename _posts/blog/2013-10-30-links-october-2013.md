Stuff that I have been reading this past month.

Things I should have known when I was 22, about two years ago. I had these questions too, I should have just asked:

  * [How should a 22 year old in India invest in money?](http://www.quora.com/Investing/How-should-a-22-year-old-in-India-invest-his-her-money "Quora post")
  * [How should a 22 year old invest time?](http://www.quora.com/Life-Advice/How-should-a-22-year-old-invest-time "Quora post")

An interesting series on job motivation, talent, organizations and their interplay:

  * <a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-to-keep-your-best-programmers" target="_blank">How to Keep your Best Programmers?</a>
  * <a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-developers-stop-learning-rise-of-the-expert-beginner" target="_blank">How Developers Stop Learning: Rise of the Expert Beginner</a>
  * <a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-software-groups-rot-legacy-of-the-expert-beginner" target="_blank">How Software Groups rot: Legacy of the Expert Beginner</a>
  * <a href="http://www.daedtech.com/how-stagnation-is-justified-language-of-the-expert-beginner" target="_blank">How Stagnation is Justified: Language of the Expert Beginner</a>
  * <a href="http://www.daedtech.com/up-or-not-ambition-of-the-expert-beginner" target="_blank">Up or Not: Ambition of the Expert Beginner</a>
  * <a href="http://www.daedtech.com/self-correcting-organizations-fall-of-the-expert-beginner" target="_blank">Self-Correcting Organizations: Fall of the Expert Beginner</a>

Normally, I would have put all of this together into a nice Readlist, but the author has published it as an [e-book](http://blogintobook.com/dietrich/ "How to Keep Your Best Programmers"). It is just a dollar, so go ahead and buy it. :smile:
