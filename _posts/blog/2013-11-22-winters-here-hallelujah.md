One of the more beautiful tunes I've heard recently has been Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. Initially, the [300](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallelujah_(Leonard_Cohen_song)#cite_note-covers-2 "Leonard Cohen - Hallelujah - YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrLk4vdY28Q" target="_blank">original</a> song, Wikipedia says, was not very successful. I wonder why, given the strong somber voice of Leonard Cohen. I was introduced to the song as part of the Shrek soundtrack, [covered](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v11rpZgzOCk "Rufus Wainwright - Hallelujah - YouTube" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB67HO8tkQs" target="_blank">performed</a> by Rufus Wainwright. The simple piano notes have the power to take you to a different mood altogether. I later found another powerful [rendition](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIF4_Sm-rgQ "Jeff Buckley - Hallelujah - YouTube") by Jeff Buckley. And then, last year, Karsh Kale <a title="Karsh Kale - Hallelujah - Coke Studio at MTV - YouTube") the track for Coke Studio at MTV with Shilpa Rao. Clearly, I've run out of adjectives to describe this composition. I'm pretty sure I will never be able to talk about the <a title="Hallelujah - Leonard Cohen Song - Wikipedia")+ covers of this song.

In other news, temperatures in Potsdam have consistently stayed in the single digit range for more than a week, and we've even had a few sub-zero nights. Yay.
