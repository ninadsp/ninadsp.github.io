The November 2013 list is ready!

  * A Reddit comment about the pros and cons of freelancing in today's world. A pretty balanced view: [http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1q1wg6/be\_a\_frontend\_engineer\_at_reddit/cd8jp4p][1]
  * An excruciatingly detailed analysis of why a certain bug at Heroku existed only in production, how did they analyse it, and their multiple attempts at fixing it: [https://blog.heroku.com/archives/2013/11/7/logplex-down-the-rabbit-hole] I only wish I had the same discipline and perseverance as these guys.
  * 6 Degrees of Lois Weisberg: [http://gladwell.com/six-degrees-of-lois-weisberg/] or [http://www.readability.com/articles/tm9hi9rh] An interesting article that I read some time ago, about how society is a giant interconnected web, and there are these spiders sitting in some locations, tweaking the web by pulling threads here and there.
  * A meta-paper on research, the author talks about what are the steps that an individual must go through, to ensure that time and resources are not wasted on non-problems: [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/ratul/papers/ccr2010-howto.pdf] . As the author mentions in the beginning, this is still an opinion piece, and not a proper research paper. Nevertheless, the opinions are compelling.
  * How Twitter keeps track of it's infrastructure: [https://blog.twitter.com/2013/observability-at-twitter]
