The December edition of things I've been reading is ready to serve, hot off the presses. This month (and the next) contain a lot of links from different Advent blogs, because they just have some amazing and at times, thought provoking content.

  * [10 Usability Heuristics](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/ "10 Usability Heuristics") &#8211; While discussing usability, software systems and configuration files, a friend passed along this neat link.
  * [Learn Vim Progressively](http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/ "Learn Vim Progressively") &#8211; Every few days, an amazing link lands up on my Twitter timeline. Unless you are a vim ninja, there will be some tip in this article that will teach you something new.
  * 24 Ways &#8211; [Git tips for giddiness](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2013/12/day-3-14-tips-for-git-giddiness-in-2014.html "24 Ways - Git for Grownups" href="http://24ways.org/2013/git-for-grownups/" target="_blank">Git for Grownups</a> and Sys Advent &#8211; <a title="Sys Advent - Day 3") &#8211; I've always struggled a little with git. These articles explain major reasons why that may be so, and *show the light*, by suggesting a few steps floundering underlings like me can take.
  * Sys Advent &#8211; [Managing Windows with PowerShell](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2013/12/day-7-managing-windows-with-powershell.html "Sys Advent - Day 7") &#8211; I've tinkered around with PowerShell at work recently, and I liked what I saw. It turns out that Microsoft has put in a lot of effort and added more features to it. More power to them!
  * Sys Advent &#8211; [Yum and repository tools by example](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2013/12/day-4-yum-and-repository-tools-by.html "Sys Advent - Day 4") &#8211; Finally, I found an article that gives me analogies from the dpkg/.deb universe to the rpm universe. A good introduction to package management, if you haven't seen this side of an OS before.
  * SysAdvent &#8211; [Sorry, Python, but I just stole virtualenv from you](http://sysadvent.blogspot.com/2013/12/day-8-sorry-python-but-i-just-stole.html "Sys Advent - Day 8") &#8211; I especially loved this for the delivery of the content, which makes complete sense if you live and breathe Python.
  * @tef's short [list][1] of interesting theses
