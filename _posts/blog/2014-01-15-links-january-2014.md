This has been a slightly slow reading month for me, as I've been reading a couple of dead tree books and travelling. But, there were still a few noteworthy articles for this month:

  * [Einstein's Camera](https://medium.com/matter/88aa8a185898 "Einstein's Camera"): A slightly long article about how an artist based out of Berlin has been hacking the concept of photography as we know it, creating surreal photos that capture a moment like no other camera.
  * [Speaking Culture at companies][1]
  * [Characteristics of the best developers](http://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2014/01/20/some-characteristics-of-the-best-developers-i-worked-with/)  according to Jaime Buelta
  * [The Moderately Enthusiastic Programmer](http://devblog.avdi.org/2014/01/31/the-moderately-enthusiastic-programmer/) by @jacobian

As for the books, I've been reading Kevin Mitnick's Ghost in the Wires, and it has so far been a nice read.
