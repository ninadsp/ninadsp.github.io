February has been a low internet activity month. I've been reading [City of Djinns](http://www.flipkart.com/city-djinns-year-delhi/p/itmczyhrgzzkzrz7 "City of Djinns on Flipkart") and Immortals of Meluha, so my time spent in reading online stuff has been limited.

  * An extensive [list](http://ryanhoover.me/post/74229429351/14-startup-postmortems "14 Startup postmortems")of Start-up post-mortems, some of which are very candid. A hattip to [@unitechy](http://twitter.com/unitechy "Unitechy on Twitter")for this link
  * [How Facebook knows what you looked at on Amazon][1]
  * [How to Debug][2]Â &#8211; A post by an associate professor who tried to teach debugging to his students
