Twitter [has](http://www.damemagazine.com/2014/02/06/i-did-not-sign-outrage "I did not sign on for outrage") [changed](http://www.mid-day.com/articles/mad-as-hell-and-cant-take-it-anymore/211551 "Twitter - Mad as Hell"). A [lot](https://twitter.com/surekhapillai/status/78121679053791233 "Surekha Pillai's musing"). There used to be a time when I looked forward to some spare time just to scroll through my timeline, to find interesting topics to discuss, and amazing people to discuss it with. Today, it has become a dumping ground for dubious 'competitions', showing off how your life is better than someone else's and last but not the least, political battlesÂ I spent ages (and a lot of energy) regularly unfollowing people. I even created private lists to keep track of a very specific set of people. I cut down on a lot of noise on the TL. Inspite of this, I still need to trawl through everything to get interesting content and people.

When I looked back, I noticed that I had not made new friends in the recent past through Twitter. I did meet some tweeps I had not met before, but I would have met them anyway thanks to the older Twitter geek groups I have been a part of. The usual gang has also relaxed and tweet a lot less. For some, priorities in life have changed. For some, Twitter is no longer the walled garden it used to be. Although the noise hasn't gone up [the way it did for Facebook][1], the signal seems to have weakened. Is there any point in continuing with this?

I took a break for the past few weeks, and I have not notice a major difference in my daily routine.

Imma gonna end my rant, and ask you to help me make this decision. I'll be around on Twitter for a few days before I take any decision. Ping me on Twitter at [@ni_nad](http://twitter.com/ni_nad "Ninad on Twitter"), and convince me to stay.

**Update**: I have decided to stay around on Twitter for some more time. I will cut down on the number of people I am following, especially people/accounts I haven't interacted with for quite some time.
