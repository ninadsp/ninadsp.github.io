Recently, I was helping some friends understand git. Instead of making my own set of slides, I searched online, as there are quite a few good posts already available online. My narrowed down list of links is:

### 101

  * Roger Dudler's The Simple Git guide - [http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ "The Simple Git Guide")
  * If you aren't looking for a slide deck, but looking for a reference-ish tutorial, Atlassian has a good tutorial at [https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial "Git Tutorial - Atlassian")
  * If you prefer the MOOC way of learning things, Code School has a course: [https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/git-real "Git on Code School")

### 102

  * For someone who has already spent some time on git (or other version control systems), Vincent Driessen's canonical Git Branching Model post (a.k.a. git-flow) is a must read: [http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ "@nvie's git-flow post")
  * If you find that you are a little lost while reading through the 2 links in the 101 section, you might want to back up a bit, and read this 24 Ways entry on git - [http://24ways.org/2013/git-for-grownups/](http://24ways.org/2013/git-for-grownups/ "Git for Grownups - 24 Ways")

### 103

If you've spent some time using git in your projects, and have a fair idea of how the basics work, attain git nirvana with the following links:

  * Pro git book: [http://git-scm.com/book](http://git-scm.com/book "Pro Git") - Sleep with this under your pillow, if you want to be the go-to guy for git in your tech-circle
  * Git Ref: [http://gitref.org/](http://gitref.org/ "Git Reference") - Use this if you are too lazy to use man pages, or live permanently in a browser
  * Sys Advent's entry on git: [http://sysadvent.blogspot.in/2013/12/day-3-14-tips-for-git-giddiness-in-2014.html](http://sysadvent.blogspot.in/2013/12/day-3-14-tips-for-git-giddiness-in-2014.html "14 git tips")

YMMV. If  I come across better resources, I'll link them here.
