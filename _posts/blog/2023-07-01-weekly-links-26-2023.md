Reading has been limited this week, and will be in the next one too, because I'm on the support rotation at work. Nevertheless, I found a few nice things to read and watch this week!

* My current Mastodon feed is very tech biased/focussed right now, and I do sometimes miss the variety of content I discovered in Twitter. But, the quality of content more than makes up for the loss in diversity. The first link is a great example in this category: [CLI Tools hidden in the Python standard library](https://til.simonwillison.net/python/stdlib-cli-tools). Many of us know about `python -m http.server` option to serve the current directory over a web server in an ad-hoc manner. There's many more in there, and the author shares a neat approach to discover them yourself.
* [brr](https://brr.fyi/) is a great collection of scenes from the Antarctic.
* Earlier this week, [Harshad](https://mastodon.sharma.io/@harshad) shared a video that had been in my YouTube recommendations too, so I watched [Email vs Capitalism, or, Why we can't have nice things](https://youtu.be/mrGfahzt-4Q) by Dylan Beattie. I knew some stuff covered in this talk, but I really enjoyed the style of presentation. I'm definitely going to find more talks by Dylan and watch them.
* Fort Nine's [review](https://youtu.be/K3xppn2STXk) of the Royal Enfield Scram 411 was a fun watch too!
* The great Reddit migration has caused a flurry of activity on the Internet, I found [sub.rehab](https://sub.rehab/) to be a neat idea to find communities again. I'm sure there are other such listings too right now, and this one currently does not discriminate between NSFW/adult content and safe content, but I found this neat. 
* If you're a fellow Site Reliability Engineer (or in a role that has a different title but similar duties), you might want to check the [SRE Survey](https://www.catchpoint.com/SRE-survey) out!

That's it for this week!
