Hello World!

It's been a while since I wrote something for the blog. In my current routine, I've found it hard to make time to sit in front of a machine after work, and have enough contiguous time that I can draft and write anything meaningful. I do have time to doom scroll though, and my urge to keep writing has been in the twilight zone of 'I still want to write', and 'I'll do it tomorrow'.

It turns out that a fair bit of progress has been made in recent times, and looking outside the traditional app stores gives me some hope. While browsing around on FDroid, I found [JekyllEx](https://jekyllex.xyz/), an app that bundles in an entire Ruby environment. This allows us to locally run Jekyll, and preview changes. This is great. I can now type small bits while I'm on the phone, and over a few 5-10 minute sessions, put in the work on a full post.

My first (successful) attempt at this has been to clone the repo within the JekyllEx app, creating a new file, and then opening that file up in [Squircle CE](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.blacksquircle.ui/), which makes it slightly easier to write in Markdown. I can then spin up the Jekyll process back in the main app, do my proof reading, and push the post back up as a git commit. These all depend on personal access tokens, which is probably fine for my current usage. I'll keep generating short lived tokens till I build more trust in this process.

If you're reading this post on my blog, it's proof that this works!
