Inspired by Sathya's [weekly notes](https://sathyabh.at/series/weekly-notes/) posts, I'm restarting my [link sharing posts](https://ninad.pundaliks.in/tags/#links) again. I suspect that the next few posts will be a mixed bag in terms of topics and themes, and maybe in the future I'll figure out how to nicely categorise them.

* [Technology Connections](https://www.patreon.com/technologyconnections), one of my favourite YouTube channels, recently posted a video about how folks in the 1980s had figured out storing digital audio on video tapes. Fascinating as usual, I was particularly impressed by how interoperable and future proof technology used to be: [https://youtu.be/xSnrQBfBCzY](https://youtu.be/xSnrQBfBCzY)
* I've been enjoying videos from the YOW conference, and [Why Static Typing Came Back](https://youtu.be/Tml94je2edk) by Richard Feldman was a nice walk down the memory lane.
* Another great talk from the same conference, [Writing for Needs - Blogging for Fun and (Not Much) Profit](https://youtu.be/hIwVqt6qtc4) prompted me to take writing up again.
* The author of Caddy, the modern web server, wrote a [detailed post](https://matt.life/writing/the-acme-protocol-in-practice-and-reality) about Let's Encrypt, their well known client/tool `certbot` and the underlying ACME protocol and how it's design was accidentally abused by a certificate authority to invoke remote code execution. As far as I understood, the RCE was never used maliciously, but the article is excellent for learning about the protocol.
* I'm currently reading through this excellent [explainer of how language models work](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/) by none other than Stephen Wolfram. I haven't finished it, but I'm enjoyed the clarity and depth.
