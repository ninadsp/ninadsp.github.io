I'm a Site Reliability Engineer with [Dyte](https://dyte.io). During the day, I do my best to keep you productive and happy at work. After work, I read, attend music concerts, find new places to eat, and drink lots of tea and coffee. Some people also say that I yap a lot. To contact me, DM me on Twitter: [@ni_nad](https://twitter.com/ni_nad "Ninad on Twitter")
